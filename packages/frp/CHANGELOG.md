# @continuum-js/frp

## 0.5.0

### Patch Changes

- 20ecab7: Error boundaries. New `<Catch fallback={(error, reset) => …}>` component:
  catches a throw while building its children (children must be a thunk) and a
  throw during any nested dynamic-region rebuild, disposes the failed
  subtree's ownership, renders the fallback, and supports `reset`. An error in
  the fallback escalates to the next boundary up; without a boundary the old
  behavior (propagating throw) is unchanged.

  Core fixes shaken out by TDD: `Behavior.listen` now registers the listener
  BEFORE the initial delivery (a set fired while handling the initial value
  was silently lost) and unsubscribes if the initial delivery throws; a
  dynamic region whose render fires a re-entrant update no longer clobbers
  the newer result (epoch guard); a throw mid-`buildScoped` disposes the
  partial scope so no half-built ownership leaks.

## 0.4.1

### Patch Changes

- a54119c: Ship the MIT LICENSE file inside every published package (the license was
  declared in package.json but the file itself was missing from tarballs).

## 0.3.0

### Minor Changes

- 20d707e: First installable release: packages now ship compiled ESM + `.d.ts` in `dist/`
  with proper `exports` maps (`@continuum-js/dom` also exposes `jsx-runtime` /
  `jsx-dev-runtime` subpaths). A clean Vite + TypeScript project can
  `npm i @continuum-js/dom` and build without any monorepo tooling.
